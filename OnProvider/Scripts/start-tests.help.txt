DETAILED DESCRIPTION

    Start-Tests executes a series of test cases. As input, the script
    expects a series of hashtables that contain at least the following
    keys:

        Name <String>

            REQUIRED. The name of the test.

        ScriptBlock <ScriptBlock>

            REQUIRED. The code to execute for the test.

        ValidateError <ScriptBlock>

            OPTIONAL. If present, this script block will be called to
            determine if any errors that result from executing
            ScriptBlock are valid.

        ExpectedString <String>

            OPTIONAL. If present, the output from executing
            ScriptBlock are compared to this string. It is an error if
            it is not an exact match.

        Validate <ScriptBlock>

            OPTIONAL. If present, the output from executing
            ScriptBlock are piped to this scriptblock for validation.

        Filter <String>

            This value can be used to control which tests execute.
            Tests that contain a Filter key will run only if a string
            matching that key is used on the Start-Tests command line.

PARAMETERS

    -Filter <String>

        If present, tests that contain a Filter key that match this
        parameter will be executed.

    -OnlyFilteredTests

        If present, only tests that have a Filter key will be
        executed. That filter key must still match the Filter
        parameter.

    -Transcript

        If present, a transcript of all tests that are executed and
        their output will be created in a file called
        "transcript.ps1."

    -Encoding <string>

        The encoding to use for the transcript. The default is ASCII.
