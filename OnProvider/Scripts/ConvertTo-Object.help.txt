SCRIPT

    ConvertTo-Object

SYNOPSIS

    Converts hashtables to objects.

DESCRIPTION

    ConvertTo-Object converts any hashtable to an object. The keys of
    the hashtable become the property names of the object. This script
    is useful when paired with the output of Export-PsOn, which tends
    to serialize complex items as hashtables.
