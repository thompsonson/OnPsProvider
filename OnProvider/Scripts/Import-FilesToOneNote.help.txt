SCRIPT

    Import-FilesToOneNote

SYNOPSIS

    Imports files into a OneNote section.

SYNTAX

    Import-FilesToOneNote [-OneNotePath] <string> [-FileSpec] <string>
    [-embed] [-SubstituteContentExtension <string>]

DETAILED DESCRIPTION

    Import-FilesToOneNote imports files into a OneNote section. It
    creates a page per file on the section. The contents of the file
    are placed on the page. Optionally, the file may be embedded in
    the page as well.

    One option that is useful for embedding scripts into the page is
    to look for a "substitute file" to provide the page content that
    is different from the file that gets embedded. You can then embed
    a .PS1 file, yet include content of the .HELP.TXT file.

PARAMETERS

    -OneNotePath <String>

    -FileSpec <string>

        The files to import. Wildcards are allowed.

    -embed

        If present, the file will get embedded into the page.
