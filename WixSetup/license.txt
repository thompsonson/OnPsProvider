1) Contribution Terms: 

By making submissions to this project, you represent that you authored
the code yourself. Codebox does not accept  submissions of source code
that is not 100% authored by Microsoft employees. You also grant users
of this project the right to both use this code  in products that they
are working and as part of a test or development tool either in Source
Code form or Released Binary form.

2) Source Code Usage Terms: 

This code has  been authored by Microsoft  employees, and is therefore
owned entirely by Microsoft. You may use  it the same  way as any code
you authored  yourself --  you may    modify it, and  incorporate  the
original  code   and your  modifications into   products that  you are
working on (assuming of course that your team's policies permit you to
do  this),  and   you  may  also   use the  original  code    and your
modifications as  test  or development tools.   The code is  Microsoft
confidential information, and therefore shouldn't be made available to
anyone other  than Microsoft FTE's or  contractors that are performing
work for Microsoft. If you would like to distribute  this code (or any
of  your  modifications)  outside of   Microsoft,  talk  to  your  LCA
contacts.

3) Release Binary Usage Terms: 

This  project's  release binaries  have   been authored  by  Microsoft
employees, and  are  therefore owned  entirely  by Microsoft. You  may
incorporate the release  binaries of this  project into products  that
you  are working on   (assuming of course   that your team's  policies
permit you to  do  this), and  you  may also use   them as a test   or
development tool. The   release  binaries are Microsoft   confidential
information, and therefore shouldn't be made available to anyone other
than  Microsoft  FTE's or  contractors that   are performing  work for
Microsoft. If   you would like  to  distribute these  release binaries
outside of Microsoft, talk to your LCA contacts.
